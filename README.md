# Capturing, cropping, and encoding timelapse video in Linux

This repo documents my adventures in learning to capture timelapse images using
only free software.

## Rough steps

1. Capture images, using either [DSLR](dslr-capture.md), [DSLR in HDR mode](dslr-hdr-capture.md) or even a plain [Webcam](webcam-capture.md).
2. [Crop and resize them](frame-sizing.md) in such a way as to maintain their correct aspect ratio.
3. [Encode the frames](video-encoding.md) into videos.
